# DigitClassification
Simple deep learning model to classify handwritten digits

In this analysis, MNIST dataset is used to train the deep learning model. The model creation and training is done using TensorFlow and Keras.

The model consists of an input layer, two hidden layers and one output layer.
The activation functions used are RELU for hidden layers and softmax for output layer. Once the training is completed, the results are visualized.
